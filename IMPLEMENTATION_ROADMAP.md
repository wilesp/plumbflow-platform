    def add_scraper(self, name, scraper_class, interval_minutes):
        """Add new scraper to pool"""
        self.scrapers[name] = scraper_class()
        self.schedule[name] = interval_minutes
    
    def run_all(self):
        """Run all scrapers in parallel"""
        with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=30) as executor:
            futures = []
            for name, scraper in self.scrapers.items():

                )
            
            # Wait for all to complete
